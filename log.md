# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read an article about [GitHub Etiquette](https://t.co/J3NOTZfmH8) and did a quick refresher on Git/GitHub. Got my computer set up with a local repo and hooked up with GitHub via Terminal.

**Thoughts:** Wow, it has been about 1.5 years since I last used GitHub. Took a while to figure it out, but glad it's all set up now - ready to commit!
