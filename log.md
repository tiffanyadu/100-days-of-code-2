# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read an article about [GitHub Etiquette](https://t.co/J3NOTZfmH8) and did a quick refresher on Git/GitHub. Got my computer set up with a local repo and hooked up with GitHub via Terminal.

**Thoughts:** Wow, it has been about 1.5 years since I last used GitHub. Took a while to figure it out, but glad it's all set up now - ready to commit!

### Day 2: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got some Github practice - forking, branching, committing, and pushing. Made my first 3 pull requests ever!

**Thoughts:** Now that I've gone through the entire pull request process, it doesn't seem quite as daunting. It's actually kinda fun, so I'm excited to see what else I can contribute to.

### Day 3: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made another 4 pull requests and completed the Hacktoberfest challenge!

**Thoughts:** Definitely feeling more comfortable with the process of doing pull requests. Ran into some trouble where GitHub didn't seem to respond after I pushed my updates. I was able to see that my new branch got added to my repo, but it's odd because it usually lets me know I can create a new pull request right after I push my changes.

### Day 4: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned I could safely move my local repository as long as all the hidden .git files are moved as well. Also worked through the Applied Visual Design section of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. Refreshed my memory about a few cool CSS properties that I never use, namely repeating-linear-gradient, a few transform functions (skewX, skewY, rotate), and @keyframes/animation.

**Thoughts:** So glad it's easy to move my local repo without messing everything up! I was so worried about it. Also, after the refresher on CSS animations, I'm excited to figure out how I can use them at work.

### Day 5: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Applied Accessibility section of FCC's RWD Certification. This covered semantic HTML and reminded me about how important it is, especially for screen readers.

**Thoughts:** It's so hard to find time to code on busy days! Decided to do some coding in the morning, but only did 30 minutes worth - will need to make up for it tomorrow. After learning about semantic HTML, I feel kind of bad about not caring much about it previously, but I'm inspired to try harder now.

### Day 6: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox sections of FCC's RWD Certification. 

**Thoughts:** I knew about flex-grow, but did not fully understand flex-shrink or flex-basis until now. These will definitely come in handy when setting sizing and proportions of children elements of a flex box.

### Day 7: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  Completed the CSS Grid section of FCC's RWD Certification. Went back to an old pen (on CodePen) and improved it.

**Thoughts:** Re-learning CSS grid has me feeling excited all over again! Too bad it's not 100% supported across browsers just yet, but it's a step in the right direction so it would be *amazing* if it becomes the standard in a few years. Was about to start one of the RWD projects, but then an old pen caught my eye. I was testing out how to implement a "frosted glass" look since I keep seeing them used in UI design. Upon revisiting, I cleaned up the code a bit and decided to fix the backgrounds so it looks as though the image is "moving" behind the frosted glass. Pretty happy with how it turned out!

### Day 8: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Installed node.js, npm, and http-server to set up a command line http server to use for local development. Got through the Getting Started Guide for Phaser.io so now I'm all set up to learn how to create my very own 2D platform game. 

**Thoughts:** I saw GitHub promoting this Game Off challenge, and I'm thinking about participating! Assuming Phaser.io isn't too difficult to learn, this sounds like a fun project and I'm excited to begin! It took a while to install all the required elements needed for local development, but at least it's all ready to go now. 

### Day 9: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the entire Making Your First Phaser 3 Game tutorial at Phaser.io and created my very first platform game! It has arcade physics, keeps score, and even has obstacles to avoid!

**Thoughts:** This is pretty amazing that I can create a simple game like this so quickly! It was relatively straight-forward and also very rewarding because I'm able to see results with just a few lines of code. Excited to learn more about this!

### Day 10: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started a tutorial on "How to Create a Turn-Based RPG" at Zenva Academy.

**Thoughts:** Got so many ideas swirling in my mind right now - hopefully this type of game isn't too difficult to set up! I didn't get much done though because I started way too late in the evening. Need to make time for this either in the morning or immediately after work to avoid being too tired to focus.
