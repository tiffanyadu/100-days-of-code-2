# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read an article about [GitHub Etiquette](https://t.co/J3NOTZfmH8) and did a quick refresher on Git/GitHub. Got my computer set up with a local repo and hooked up with GitHub via Terminal.

**Thoughts:** Wow, it has been about 1.5 years since I last used GitHub. Took a while to figure it out, but glad it's all set up now - ready to commit!

### Day 2: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got some Github practice - forking, branching, committing, and pushing. Made my first 3 pull requests ever!

**Thoughts:** Now that I've gone through the entire pull request process, it doesn't seem quite as daunting. It's actually kinda fun, so I'm excited to see what else I can contribute to.

### Day 3: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made another 4 pull requests and completed the Hacktoberfest challenge!

**Thoughts:** Definitely feeling more comfortable with the process of doing pull requests. Ran into some trouble where GitHub didn't seem to respond after I pushed my updates. I was able to see that my new branch got added to my repo, but it's odd because it usually lets me know I can create a new pull request right after I push my changes.

### Day 4: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned I could safely move my local repository as long as all the hidden .git files are moved as well. Also worked through the Applied Visual Design section of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. Refreshed my memory about a few cool CSS properties that I never use, namely repeating-linear-gradient, a few transform functions (skewX, skewY, rotate), and @keyframes/animation.

**Thoughts:** So glad it's easy to move my local repo without messing everything up! I was so worried about it. Also, after the refresher on CSS animations, I'm excited to figure out how I can use them at work.

### Day 5: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Applied Accessibility section of FCC's RWD Certification. This covered semantic HTML and reminded me about how important it is, especially for screen readers.

**Thoughts:** It's so hard to find time to code on busy days! Decided to do some coding in the morning, but only did 30 minutes worth - will need to make up for it tomorrow. After learning about semantic HTML, I feel kind of bad about not caring much about it previously, but I'm inspired to try harder now.

### Day 6: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox sections of FCC's RWD Certification. 

**Thoughts:** I knew about flex-grow, but did not fully understand flex-shrink or flex-basis until now. These will definitely come in handy when setting sizing and proportions of children elements of a flex box.

### Day 7: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  Completed the CSS Grid section of FCC's RWD Certification. Went back to an old pen (on CodePen) and improved it.

**Thoughts:** Re-learning CSS grid has me feeling excited all over again! Too bad it's not 100% supported across browsers just yet, but it's a step in the right direction so it would be *amazing* if it becomes the standard in a few years. Was about to start one of the RWD projects, but then an old pen caught my eye. I was testing out how to implement a "frosted glass" look since I keep seeing them used in UI design. Upon revisiting, I cleaned up the code a bit and decided to fix the backgrounds so it looks as though the image is "moving" behind the frosted glass. Pretty happy with how it turned out!

### Day 8: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Installed node.js, npm, and http-server to set up a command line http server to use for local development. Got through the Getting Started Guide for Phaser.io so now I'm all set up to learn how to create my very own 2D platform game. 

**Thoughts:** I saw GitHub promoting this Game Off challenge, and I'm thinking about participating! Assuming Phaser.io isn't too difficult to learn, this sounds like a fun project and I'm excited to begin! It took a while to install all the required elements needed for local development, but at least it's all ready to go now. 

### Day 9: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the entire Making Your First Phaser 3 Game tutorial at Phaser.io and created my very first platform game! It has arcade physics, keeps score, and even has obstacles to avoid!

**Thoughts:** This is pretty amazing that I can create a simple game like this so quickly! It was relatively straight-forward and also very rewarding because I'm able to see results with just a few lines of code. Excited to learn more about this!

### Day 10: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started a tutorial on "How to Create a Turn-Based RPG" at Zenva Academy.

**Thoughts:** Got so many ideas swirling in my mind right now - hopefully this type of game isn't too difficult to set up! I didn't get much done though because I started way too late in the evening. Need to make time for this either in the morning or immediately after work to avoid being too tired to focus.

### Day 11: November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the same tutorial ("How to Create a Turn-Based RPG" at Zenva Academy) and completed Part 1.

**Thoughts:** Ran into an issue with my player's walk cycle not animating properly when going left or right. Spent nearly an hour trying to troubleshoot it with no avail, so I'm feeling pretty frustrated.

### Day 12: November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Troubleshooted the bug from yesterday and started Part 2 of "How to Create a Turn-Based RPG" at Zenva Academy.

**Thoughts:** Managed to fix that bug within the first 10 minutes of tonight's session! It's amazing what a break can do for your mind! I was trying to keep my code DRY so I had combined the two sets of if-else statements from the tutorial. Didn't realize the walk cycle animations needed to be grouped together in a bunch of else-if statements, but now I will never forget! This next step of the tutorial series that is setting up the battle scene is a bit confusing, but hopefully things will get clearer once I get to the end.

### Day 13: November 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed Part 2 of the same tutorial from yesterday.

**Thoughts:** Unsure whether it's me or the tutorial, but the very last bit where we display a message in the battle scene is not working for me. Starting to feel like I wasted time with this because there isn't a whole lot of explaination to help me understand what the code is doing, plus, there doesn't seem to be a part 3 for this turn-based rpg game just yet. Will need to switch gears tomorrow and work on something that will help me advance in my career.

### Day 14: November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started creating my own Phaser 3 game based on the few tutorials I've done so far.

**Thoughts:** It's going to be tough putting together a game by the end of the month - think I've bitten off more than I can chew since I'm still not very familiar with Phase.io. We'll see what I can accomplish over the next week. May need to work on a simpler project to start.

### Day 15: November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Responsive Web Design Project - Build a Survey Form for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Need to spend time updating my portfolio, so I decided to take it easy tonight. Still was a bit of a challenge since I haven't built a form from scratch in forever, but it's definitely good to review these html tags and attributes.

### Day 16: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first half of the Basic Javascript section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I've worked with Javascript so this was yet another refresher for me - forgot how fun it was! I only managed to get through the super basic stuff tonight, so I can wait until I get to one of the puzzles. Hopefully I can pick up where I left off last year relatively easily.

### Day 17: November 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through the Basic Javascript section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Covered the switch statements, objects, and how to access/modify/add object properties with dot notation, bracket notation, and variables. Also learned about the .hasOwnProperty() method and how to delete properties, both of which are completely new to me, and completed the Record Collection challenge.

**Thoughts:** I feel terrible about skipping 3 days in a row, but it was such a busy week that I literally had no time or energy to put towards coding until today. Finally getting to the part of javascript that I'm less comfortable with though, so now I can pick up where I left off last year and start "leveling up"! Missed a few small details when attempting the Record collection challenge the first time around, so after I solved it, I restarted the challenge to be sure I didn't just stumble upon the correct answer. Got it right on the first try in my second attempt, so I'd say I actually know what I'm doing now, haha.

### Day 18: November 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Basic Javascript section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp! Covered for, while, and do...while loops, Math.random(), parseInt(), and conditional (ternary) operators.

**Thoughts:** The Profile Lookup challenge was pretty fun to do. Did not think to place the final return statement outside of the for loop, so it will take some practice to truly understand why it belongs there instead of inside the loop. Looking forward to learning ES6!

### Day 19: November 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the ES6 section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed the following:
* let vs. const
* Object.freeze()
* arrow functions
* map(), filter(), and reduce() methods
* default parameters
* rest and spread operators
* destructuring assigment

**Thoughts:** I remember most of this from last year, but struggled a bit with the destructuring assignment portion. Got to keep pushing forward!

### Day 20: November 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the ES6 section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed the following:
* template & object literals
* constructor functions
* get & set functions
* import, require, export, & export defaults

**Thoughts:** Either I'm brain-dead tonight or this last bit of the ES6 section is dense! Having a hard time understanding the concepts as well as when and why I would use them. Maybe this will all become clearer later on when I get a chance to actually practice using them.

### Day 21: November 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started the Regular Expressions section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed the following:
* test() and match() methods
* i and g flags
* wildcard dot/period
* character classes + shorthand

**Thoughts:** Feel like I have a better understanding of the regex syntax after going through this lesson – it's still a lot to remember though.

### Day 22: November 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Regular Expressions and started the Debugging sections (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed the following:
* how to specify upper, lower, and exact number of matches and how to check for all or none
* positive & negative lookaheads
* capture groups

**Thoughts:** Feeling quite confused with the more complicated concepts towards the end of the RegEx lessons. Maybe it will just take some practice to get comfortable with lookaheads and capture groups, but I had a hard time solving the last couple of challenges without any hints.

### Day 23: November 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Debugging and Basic Data Structures sections (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed the following:
* console.log & console.clear
* typeof method
* common mistakes to watch out for
* reinitializing variables inside a loop
* splice() & slice() array methods
* copying and combining arrats with spread operator
* add, modify, remove, & iterate through keys in objects

**Thoughts:** Glad that the Basic Data Structure lessons reviewed concepts from earlier lessons because I barely remember how to use them! Will be starting the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges tomorrow, so we'll see how much of this info I've actually retained.

### Day 24: November 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got through half of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** So happy to finally get to apply what I've learned on these puzzles. A bit of a challenge, but extremely satisfying once I figure it out.

### Day 25: November 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed a few more of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was quite stumped by the Title Case a Sentence challenge – had to look at a couple hints in order to figure out what to do.

### Day 26: November 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Wow, this Falsey Bouncer challenge is a tough one. Tried so many things without making much progress, but I think the issue here is that I don't fully understand what makes something "falsey". Will need to come back to it tomorrow!

### Day 27: December 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Had to look up the answer for Falsey Bouncer, but still don't quite understand how the filter method works with the Boolean value. Also had a lot of trouble with the last challenge, Chunky Monkey! Need to review how/why this code works. 

### Day 28: December 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Object Oriented Programming section and started the Functional Programming Challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed the following:
* Objects - properties & methods
* Constructors
* Own & prototype properties
* Changing prototypes into new objects
* instanceof & isPrototypeOf methods
* Prototype chain, Supertypes, inheritance, mixins
* Closures & private properties
* Immediated Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) & using it to create a module
* Callbacks, first class vs. higher order functions
* Mutations, side effects, & pure functions

**Thoughts:** I think I have a pretty good grasp on Objects and Constructors and how to manipulate them. The functional programming concepts are making sense so far, but we'll see how complex this section's lessons get.

### Day 29: December 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Functional Programming challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp and reviewed the map and filter methods.

**Thoughts:** Having to reverse-engineer those map and filter methods was SUCH a great exercise! Really helped to reinforce what those methods do and how they work exactly.

### Day 30: December 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Functional Programming challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp and reviewed the following:
* slice vs. splice methods
* concat vs. push methods
* reduce vs. filter vs. map methods
* sort, split, join methods

**Thoughts:** This is such a great section of FCC! So glad to get more practice with all those methods to solve these simpler puzzles. Much more digestible compared to some of the previous scripting challenges!

### Day 31: December 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finally done with the Functional Programming section and started the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp and reviewed the following:
* every & some methods
* currying & partial application

**Thoughts:** Here we go – I was right to anticipate having difficulties with these challenges. Got stuck on the second one, "Diff Two Arrays". Not quite sure how to approach this challenge, but hopefully a fresh start tomorrow will help.

### Day 32: December 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Feel terrible about skipping SO many days in a row! But with how busy I've been at work, it was some much needed rest. Had a lot of trouble with the Diff Two Arrays challenge, but I managed to figure it out on my own without looking up the solution, so I'm quite satisfied with that!

### Day 33: December 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Managed to solve a couple of these challenges, but only after checking out the hints. The Wherefore Art Thou challenge was the worst though! I don't quite understand why it needs to use the .every() method? It seems like it should work without it. Also, feeling quite annoyed that the official solutions listed by FreeCodeCamp don't even try to use the supplied arr variable! I've been trying to push the results to that array, but for whatever reason, that doesn't pass. Ugh.

### Day 34: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The holiday season was so busy this in 2018 that I had to take a break from coding to catch up on everything! Finally back on it though and it feels pretty great to be exercising my scripting skills again. Got through a couple of these challenges without too much trouble, so that's extremely satisfying! Also, I found this site (https://regexr.com/) that gives you a visual of what regex characters you're selecting and it's been extremely helpful in helping me understand it better.

### Day 35: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Only managed to solve one scripting challenge tonight, Search and Replace. Had some trouble in the beginning when trying to figure out how to title case a string, then remembered that you can target the first letter of a string by using the charAt() method. I also learned that assignment operators (+, +=) offer faster performance when compared to the concat() method, so this is very good to know!

### Day 36: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Solved the DNA Pairing challenge with ZERO hints, only documentation, and Missing Letters with just ONE hint, so I'm quite proud of that! Think I'm starting to get a hang of this because it's a bit easier to figure out which method to use and how to use them (with a bit of help from documentation). Excited to keep pushing forward.

### Day 37: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Solved the Sorted Union and Convert HTML Entities challenges without any hints! It may have took a bit longer to figure out, but it's more satisfying to get it right all on my own.

### Day 38: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Worked on updating my resume and portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** In preparation for my job hunt next month, I updated my resume and fixed the broken twitter widget on my portfolio website tonight. Want to get some new projects added ASAP so I can start applying!

### Day 39: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Only got through one scripting challenge tonight – the one called Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers really tripped me up! Had a hard time figuring out how to even get the fibonacci sequence output. I ended up using 3 separate variables to store the previous, current, and next values in the sequence. This officially solves the puzzle, but probably isn't the most efficient, so I'll need to check out FreeCodeCamp's solutions to see what they did.

### Day 40: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Worked on the Sum All Primes scripting challenge for the entire hour - this one has me quite stumped! Can't seem to wrap my mind around how to distinguish a number as prime. Will need to look at this again with fresh eyes tomorrow.

### Day 41: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Finally solved the Sum All Primes scripting challenge! I had to check out a hint or two before I got it - the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" Wiki page helped tremendously. It broke down how to find a prime number and those steps are what I based my code on. Not sure if it's the most efficient solution, but it works and makes more sense to me than the solutions on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 42: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel bad about skipping a couple days again, but social obligations and my mom's birthday mean I don't have enough time or energy to work on this...back at it today though! Worked on the Smallest Common Multiple, Drop It, and Steamroller scripting challenges - not nearly as difficult as a few of the previous ones, so hopefully that means I'm getting better. I can't wait to wrap up this section of FreeCodeCamp though because it's taking forever!

### Day 43: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Completed Binary Agents and Everything Be True, but got stuck on Arguments Optional - having trouble understanding how to write recursive functions. Will need to try again tomorrow!!

### Day 44: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Back on the Arguments Optional scripting challenge. Accidentally wrote an infinite loop and broke the page, so I finally caved in and checked out the solutions and realized I needed to return a new function. Not sure why I kept thinking it needed to be recursive, but at least now I know. I also solved Make a Person, so there's only 1 scripting challenge left!

### Day 45: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:** FINALLY completed the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges and started the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects section (Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Glad that math was one of my best subjects in school because this last scripting challenge was quite easy! So happy to be done with this section though because I've spent roughly 15 hours total on it! Completed both Map the Debris and the first project, Palindrome Checker, without any hints so I'd say it's been a good night. 

### Day 46: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects section (Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The last 4 days were SUPER busy so I wasn't able to find time to code. Worked on the Roman Numeral Converter today and ended up solving it with a long list of switch statements, which I'm sure is NOT the most efficient code but at least I solved it without any help. When looking at FreeCodeCamp's basic solution, I was surprised that it was able to accommodate for the repeated values with so little code! It's such an elegant solution, I'll need to remember this one for future reference.

### Day 47: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects section (Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Solved the Caesars Cipher challenge in about 15 minutes with no hints so that was very satisfying. The Telephone Number Validator was much tougher though. I'm able to pass most of the test except for the ones that only has 1 of 2 parentheses and the one that begins with a hyphen. Will need to come back to this tomorrow.
