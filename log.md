# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read an article about [GitHub Etiquette](https://t.co/J3NOTZfmH8) and did a quick refresher on Git/GitHub. Got my computer set up with a local repo and hooked up with GitHub via Terminal.

**Thoughts:** Wow, it has been about 1.5 years since I last used GitHub. Took a while to figure it out, but glad it's all set up now - ready to commit!

### Day 2: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got some Github practice - forking, branching, committing, and pushing. Made my first 3 pull requests ever!

**Thoughts:** Now that I've gone through the entire pull request process, it doesn't seem quite as daunting. It's actually kinda fun, so I'm excited to see what else I can contribute to.

### Day 3: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made another 4 pull requests and completed the Hacktoberfest challenge!

**Thoughts:** Definitely feeling more comfortable with the process of doing pull requests. Ran into some trouble where GitHub didn't seem to respond after I pushed my updates. I was able to see that my new branch got added to my repo, but it's odd because it usually lets me know I can create a new pull request right after I push my changes.

### Day 4: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned I could safely move my local repository as long as all the hidden .git files are moved as well. Also worked through the Applied Visual Design section of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. Refreshed my memory about a few cool CSS properties that I never use, namely repeating-linear-gradient, a few transform functions (skewX, skewY, rotate), and @keyframes/animation.

**Thoughts:** So glad it's easy to move my local repo without messing everything up! I was so worried about it. Also, after the refresher on CSS animations, I'm excited to figure out how I can use them at work.

### Day 5: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Applied Accessibility section of FCC's RWD Certification. This covered semantic HTML and reminded me about how important it is, especially for screen readers.

**Thoughts:** It's so hard to find time to code on busy days! Decided to do some coding in the morning, but only did 30 minutes worth - will need to make up for it tomorrow. After learning about semantic HTML, I feel kind of bad about not caring much about it previously, but I'm inspired to try harder now.

### Day 6: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, and CSS Flexbox sections of FCC's RWD Certification. 

**Thoughts:** I knew about flex-grow, but did not fully understand flex-shrink or flex-basis until now. These will definitely come in handy when setting sizing and proportions of children elements of a flex box.

### Day 7: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  Completed the CSS Grid section of FCC's RWD Certification. Went back to an old pen (on CodePen) and improved it.

**Thoughts:** Re-learning CSS grid has me feeling excited all over again! Too bad it's not 100% supported across browsers just yet, but it's a step in the right direction so it would be *amazing* if it becomes the standard in a few years. Was about to start one of the RWD projects, but then an old pen caught my eye. I was testing out how to implement a "frosted glass" look since I keep seeing them used in UI design. Upon revisiting, I cleaned up the code a bit and decided to fix the backgrounds so it looks as though the image is "moving" behind the frosted glass. Pretty happy with how it turned out!

### Day 8: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Installed node.js, npm, and http-server to set up a command line http server to use for local development. Got through the Getting Started Guide for Phaser.io so now I'm all set up to learn how to create my very own 2D platform game. 

**Thoughts:** I saw GitHub promoting this Game Off challenge, and I'm thinking about participating! Assuming Phaser.io isn't too difficult to learn, this sounds like a fun project and I'm excited to begin! It took a while to install all the required elements needed for local development, but at least it's all ready to go now. 

### Day 9: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the entire Making Your First Phaser 3 Game tutorial at Phaser.io and created my very first platform game! It has arcade physics, keeps score, and even has obstacles to avoid!

**Thoughts:** This is pretty amazing that I can create a simple game like this so quickly! It was relatively straight-forward and also very rewarding because I'm able to see results with just a few lines of code. Excited to learn more about this!

### Day 10: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started a tutorial on "How to Create a Turn-Based RPG" at Zenva Academy.

**Thoughts:** Got so many ideas swirling in my mind right now - hopefully this type of game isn't too difficult to set up! I didn't get much done though because I started way too late in the evening. Need to make time for this either in the morning or immediately after work to avoid being too tired to focus.

### Day 11: November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the same tutorial ("How to Create a Turn-Based RPG" at Zenva Academy) and completed Part 1.

**Thoughts:** Ran into an issue with my player's walk cycle not animating properly when going left or right. Spent nearly an hour trying to troubleshoot it with no avail, so I'm feeling pretty frustrated.

### Day 12: November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Troubleshooted the bug from yesterday and started Part 2 of "How to Create a Turn-Based RPG" at Zenva Academy.

**Thoughts:** Managed to fix that bug within the first 10 minutes of tonight's session! It's amazing what a break can do for your mind! I was trying to keep my code DRY so I had combined the two sets of if-else statements from the tutorial. Didn't realize the walk cycle animations needed to be grouped together in a bunch of else-if statements, but now I will never forget! This next step of the tutorial series that is setting up the battle scene is a bit confusing, but hopefully things will get clearer once I get to the end.

### Day 13: November 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed Part 2 of the same tutorial from yesterday.

**Thoughts:** Unsure whether it's me or the tutorial, but the very last bit where we display a message in the battle scene is not working for me. Starting to feel like I wasted time with this because there isn't a whole lot of explaination to help me understand what the code is doing, plus, there doesn't seem to be a part 3 for this turn-based rpg game just yet. Will need to switch gears tomorrow and work on something that will help me advance in my career.

### Day 14: November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started creating my own Phaser 3 game based on the few tutorials I've done so far.

**Thoughts:** It's going to be tough putting together a game by the end of the month - think I've bitten off more than I can chew since I'm still not very familiar with Phase.io. We'll see what I can accomplish over the next week. May need to work on a simpler project to start.

### Day 15: November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Responsive Web Design Project - Build a Survey Form for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Need to spend time updating my portfolio, so I decided to take it easy tonight. Still was a bit of a challenge since I haven't built a form from scratch in forever, but it's definitely good to review these html tags and attributes.

### Day 16: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first half of the Basic Javascript section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I've worked with Javascript so this was yet another refresher for me - forgot how fun it was! I only managed to get through the super basic stuff tonight, so I can wait until I get to one of the puzzles. Hopefully I can pick up where I left off last year relatively easily.

### Day 17: November 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through the Basic Javascript section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Covered the switch statements, objects, and how to access/modify/add object properties with dot notation, bracket notation, and variables. Also learned about the .hasOwnProperty() method and how to delete properties, both of which are completely new to me, and completed the Record Collection challenge.

**Thoughts:** I feel terrible about skipping 3 days in a row, but it was such a busy week that I literally had no time or energy to put towards coding until today. Finally getting to the part of javascript that I'm less comfortable with though, so now I can pick up where I left off last year and start "leveling up"! Missed a few small details when attempting the Record collection challenge the first time around, so after I solved it, I restarted the challenge to be sure I didn't just stumble upon the correct answer. Got it right on the first try in my second attempt, so I'd say I actually know what I'm doing now, haha.

### Day 18: November 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Basic Javascript section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp! Covered for, while, and do...while loops, Math.random(), parseInt(), and conditional (ternary) operators.

**Thoughts:** The Profile Lookup challenge was pretty fun to do. Did not think to place the final return statement outside of the for loop, so it will take some practice to truly understand why it belongs there instead of inside the loop. Looking forward to learning ES6!

### Day 19: November 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the ES6 section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed the following:
* let vs. const
* Object.freeze()
* arrow functions
* map(), filter(), and reduce() methods
* default parameters
* rest and spread operators
* destructuring assigment

**Thoughts:** I remember most of this from last year, but struggled a bit with the destructuring assignment portion. Got to keep pushing forward!

### Day 20: November 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the ES6 section (of Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification) on FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed the following:
* template & object literals
* constructor functions
* get & set functions
* import, require, export, & export defaults

**Thoughts:** Either I'm brain-dead tonight or this last bit of the ES6 section is dense! Having a hard time understanding the concepts as well as when and why I would use them. Maybe this will all become clearer later on when I get a chance to actually practice using them.
