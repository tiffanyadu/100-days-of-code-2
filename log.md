# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read an article about [GitHub Etiquette](https://t.co/J3NOTZfmH8) and did a quick refresher on Git/GitHub. Got my computer set up with a local repo and hooked up with GitHub via Terminal.

**Thoughts:** Wow, it has been about 1.5 years since I last used GitHub. Took a while to figure it out, but glad it's all set up now - ready to commit!

### Day 2: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got some Github practice - forking, branching, committing, and pushing. Made my first 3 pull requests ever!

**Thoughts:** Now that I've gone through the entire pull request process, it doesn't seem quite as daunting. It's actually kinda fun, so I'm excited to see what else I can contribute to.

### Day 3: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made another 4 pull requests and completed the Hacktoberfest challenge!

**Thoughts:** Definitely feeling more comfortable with the process of doing pull requests. Ran into some trouble where GitHub didn't seem to respond after I pushed my updates. I was able to see that my new branch got added to my repo, but it's odd because it usually lets me know I can create a new pull request right after I push my changes.
